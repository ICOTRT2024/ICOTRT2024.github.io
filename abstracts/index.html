                Operadic categories were introduced by Batanin and Markl as a tool for handling various kind of generalised operads. These are categories over the category of finite sets equipped with some additional structures of which the most important is the existence of abstract fiber functors for  morphisms. These structures must satisfy some finite number of axioms which are necessary to associate a category of generalised operads for each operadic category.
<br>
                In my talk I will show how to assign a pseudosimplicial symmetric monoidal groupoid to each operadic category which we call operadic nerve. Conversely I will give a characterization of pseudosimplicial symmetric monoidal groupoids which are operadic nerves of operadic categories. I also explain what is an operad over an operadic category in this intrinsic simplicial language. This approach allows a generalization to \(\infty\)-groupoidal setting and so a definition of  \(\infty\)-operadic categories and corresponding \(\infty\)-operads. This is joint work with Joachim Kock, Martin Markl and Mark Weber.

                The Deligne conjecture, many times
                a theorem, states that for a dg category \(C\), the dg endomorphisms
                \(End(Id_C)\) of the identity functor-- that is, the Hochschild
                cochains-- carries a natural structure of 2-algebra. When \(C\) is
                endowed with a Calabi-Yau structure, then Hochschild cochains and
                Hochschild chains are identified up to a shift, and we may transport
                the circle action from Hochschild chains onto Hochschild
                cochains. The cyclic Deligne conjecture states that the 2-algebra
                structure and the circle action together give a framed 2-algebra
                structure on Hochschild cochains. We establish the cyclic Deligne conjecture, 
                as well as a variation that works for relative Calabi-Yau
                structures on dg functors \(D\rightarrow C\), more generally for functors between stable 
                infinity categories. We discuss examples coming from
                oriented manifolds with boundary, Fano varieties with anticanonical
                divisor, and doubled quivers with preprojective relation. This is

                In this talk, I will introduce a (de)coloring method in operad theory which is compatible with Koszul duality theory. More specific, we developed the coloring process from (ordinary) operads to colored operads via the “nice coloring” of operads. It is proved that the coloring process is compatible with taking min-imal models and Koszul duality theory. Finally, I will give its application to the minimal model of the colored operad of relative Rota-Baxter Lie algebras.

                Novikov algebras are important nonassociative algebras that originally appeared in the study

                theory in the chiral world. We will then discuss the deformation theory of chiral algebras, especially the formality 
                conjecture. Subsequently, we will turn to chiral Koszul duality and quadratic duality, emphasizing their roles in understanding

                of the operadic Koszul duality. In this talk, I will introduce a bialgebra theory for the Novikov algebra,
                 namely the Novikov bialgebra, which is characterized by the fact that its affinization (by a quadratic right Novikov
                  algebra) gives an infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebra, suggesting a Koszul duality for properads. If time permites, I will also

                            Vertex and conformal algebras appeared as formal tools of the conformal field (CFT) theory in mathematical physics. One of the basic statements in the theory of vertex algebras is known as the Dong Lemma: a family of pairwise local formal distributions (“fields”') over a Lie algebra generates a vertex algebra relative to the operations of formal derivations and n-products. A similar statement makes sense for not only Lie algebras, but for an arbitrary variety, e.g., for associative algebras. We say that an operad Var has the Dong Property if the conformal n-products of formal distributions over every Var-algebra preserve locality. Examples of Dong operads include the well-known Lie, As (hence, Com), but also Pois and Novikov. On the other hand, the operads preLie, Dend, Zinb do not have the Dong Property. We will observe how the Dong Property behaves under some common operations on operads, such as replication and splitting, Koszul duality and Manin products.

    In the recent paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17103">arXiv:2409.17103v1</a>, we propose a new program to address a long-standing open problem: how to construct a meaningful unitary topological quantum field theory (TQFT) in arbitrary dimension. We construct a unitary n+1 alterfold TQFT from a linear functional on labelled regular stratified piecewise linear n-manifolds. This can be considered as a n-dimensional lattice model. An unitary n-category from higher representations emerges as its local quantum symmtry. The n+1 alterfold TQFT captures its global symmetry. In particular, we construct a non-invertible unitary 3+1 alterfold TQFT from a linear functional and derive its local quantum symmetry as a unitary spherical 3-category of Ising type with explicit 20j-symbols, so that the scalar invariant of 2-knots in piecewise linear 4-manifolds could be computed explicitly.

        Algebraic operads provide a powerful tool to understand the homotopy theory of the types of (co)algebras they encode. So far, the principal results and methods that this theory provides were only available in characteristic zero. The main reason is that operads carry an action of all the symmetric groups, whose representation theory is involved in positive characteristic. The goal of this talk will be to explain how one can extend these results and methods over a positive characteristic field. This is joint work with Brice Le Grignou.     </td>

The main motivation comes from its applicability to String Theory, with quiver gauge theories playing a crucial role in the setting. However, as we shall see, generalising functorial HMS also constitutes a promising setting for pure mathematics advancements in their own right.

                    Guided by Koszul duality theory, we consider the graded Lie algebra of coderivations of the cofree conilpotent graded cocommutative cotrialgebra generated by $V$. We show that in the case of \(V\) being a shift of an ungraded vector space $W$, Maurer-Cartan elements of this graded Lie algebra are exactly  post-Lie algebra structures on \(W\). The cohomology of a post-Lie algebra  is then defined using Maurer-Cartan twisting. The second cohomology group of a post-Lie algebra has a familiar interpretation as equivalence classes of infinitesimal deformations. Next we define a post-Lie(_\infty\) algebra structure  on a graded vector space to be a Maurer-Cartan element of the aforementioned graded Lie algebra. Post-Lie\(_\infty\) algebras admit a useful characterization in terms of \(L_\infty\)-actions (or open-closed homotopy Lie algebras). Finally, we introduce the notion of homotopy Rota-Baxter operators on open-closed homotopy Lie algebras and show that certain homotopy Rota-Baxter operators induce post-Lie\(_\infty\) algebras.	       </td>

                            We first study the equivalence of categories involving (prime) saturated symmetric operads. Then we classify finitely generated prime symmetric operads of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 1 and finitely generated saturated linear symmetric operads. This is a joint work with Yu Li, Zihao Qi, Yongjun Xu, James J. Zhang and Xiangui Zhao.

                            In this talk, we study the growth and Gelfand-Kirillov dimension (GK-dimension) of operads. In particular, analogues of Bergman's gap theorem are proved for operads, namely, no finitely generated locally finite nonsymmetric (resp., symmetric) operad has GK-dimension strictly between 1 and 2. On the contrary, for an arbitrary real number \(r\geq 1\), there exist shuffle operads of GK-dimension \(r\).This is a joint work with Yu Li, Zihao Qi, Yongjun Xu, James Zhang, and Zerui Zhang.
