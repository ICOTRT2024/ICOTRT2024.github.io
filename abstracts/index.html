                Novikov algebras are important nonassociative algebras that originally appeared in the study 
                of Hamiltonian operators in the formal calculus of variations by Gelfand and Dorfman, and then
                 rediscovered by Balinskii and Novikov in the context of classification of linear Poisson brackets 
                 of hydrodynamical type. In this talk, I shall present two recent results about varieties of Novikov algebras 
                 over a field of zero characteristic: first, I shall explain that every variety of Novikov algebras is defined by 
                 finitely many identities (that is, has the Specht property), and second, I shall present a classification of all 
                 varieties of Novikov algebras whose lattice of subvarieties is distributive. These results are obtained in collaboration 
                 with N. Ismailov and U. Umirbaev (the first one) and with B. Zhakhayev (the second one).            </td>

                In this talk, we will discuss the theory of chiral algebras through the framework 
                of operads. We start by introducing chiral operads and define chiral algebras, connecting them to 
                vertex algebras. Next, we review the theory of chiral homology which can be seen as the Hochschild homology 
                theory in the chiral world. We will then discuss the deformation theory of chiral algebras, especially the formality 
                conjecture. Subsequently, we will turn to chiral Koszul duality and quadratic duality, emphasizing their roles in understanding 
                the structure of chiral algebras. If time permits, we will briefly touch on higher-dimensional chiral operads and their implications.    </td>    </tr>

                Balinsky and Novikov showed that the affinization of a Novikov algebra naturally defines 
                a Lie algebra, a property that in fact characterizes the Novikov algebra. It is also an instance 
                of the operadic Koszul duality. In this talk, I will introduce a bialgebra theory for the Novikov algebra,
                 namely the Novikov bialgebra, which is characterized by the fact that its affinization (by a quadratic right Novikov
                  algebra) gives an infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebra, suggesting a Koszul duality for properads. If time permites, I will also
                   introduce a construction of Novikov bialgebras from commutative and cocommutative admissible differential antisymmetric infinitesimal 
                   bialgebras. This talk is based on joint works with Chengming Bai and Li Guo.   </td></tr> </table>
