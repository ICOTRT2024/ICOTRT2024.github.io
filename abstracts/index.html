                Novikov algebras are important nonassociative algebras that originally appeared in the study 
                of Hamiltonian operators in the formal calculus of variations by Gelfand and Dorfman, and then
                 rediscovered by Balinskii and Novikov in the context of classification of linear Poisson brackets 
                 of hydrodynamical type. In this talk, I shall present two recent results about varieties of Novikov algebras 
                 over a field of zero characteristic: first, I shall explain that every variety of Novikov algebras is defined by 
                 finitely many identities (that is, has the Specht property), and second, I shall present a classification of all 
                 varieties of Novikov algebras whose lattice of subvarieties is distributive. These results are obtained in collaboration 
                 with N. Ismailov and U. Umirbaev (the first one) and with B. Zhakhayev (the second one).            </td>

                In this talk, we will discuss the theory of chiral algebras through the framework 
                of operads. We start by introducing chiral operads and define chiral algebras, connecting them to 
                vertex algebras. Next, we review the theory of chiral homology which can be seen as the Hochschild homology 
                theory in the chiral world. We will then discuss the deformation theory of chiral algebras, especially the formality 
                conjecture. Subsequently, we will turn to chiral Koszul duality and quadratic duality, emphasizing their roles in understanding 
                the structure of chiral algebras. If time permits, we will briefly touch on higher-dimensional chiral operads and their implications.    </td>    </tr>

                Balinsky and Novikov showed that the affinization of a Novikov algebra naturally defines 
                a Lie algebra, a property that in fact characterizes the Novikov algebra. It is also an instance 
                of the operadic Koszul duality. In this talk, I will introduce a bialgebra theory for the Novikov algebra,
                 namely the Novikov bialgebra, which is characterized by the fact that its affinization (by a quadratic right Novikov
                  algebra) gives an infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebra, suggesting a Koszul duality for properads. If time permites, I will also
                   introduce a construction of Novikov bialgebras from commutative and cocommutative admissible differential antisymmetric infinitesimal 
                   bialgebras. This talk is based on joint works with Chengming Bai and Li Guo.

                            Vertex and conformal algebras appeared as formal tools of the conformal field (CFT) theory in mathematical physics. One of the basic statements in the theory of vertex algebras is known as the Dong Lemma: a family of pairwise local formal distributions (“fields”') over a Lie algebra generates a vertex algebra relative to the operations of formal derivations and n-products. A similar statement makes sense for not only Lie algebras, but for an arbitrary variety, e.g., for associative algebras. We say that an operad Var has the Dong Property if the conformal n-products of formal distributions over every Var-algebra preserve locality. Examples of Dong operads include the well-known Lie, As (hence, Com), but also Pois and Novikov. On the other hand, the operads preLie, Dend, Zinb do not have the Dong Property. We will observe how the Dong Property behaves under some common operations on operads, such as replication and splitting, Koszul duality and Manin products.

    In the recent paper arXiv:2409.17103v1, we propose a new program to address a long-standing open problem: how to construct a meaningful unitary topological quantum field theory (TQFT) in arbitrary dimension. We construct a unitary n+1 alterfold TQFT from a linear functional on labelled regular stratified piecewise linear n-manifolds. This can be considered as a n-dimensional lattice model. An unitary n-category from higher representations emerges as its local quantum symmtry. The n+1 alterfold TQFT captures its global symmetry. In particular, we construct a non-invertible unitary 3+1 alterfold TQFT from a linear functional and derive its local quantum symmetry as a unitary spherical 3-category of Ising type with explicit 20j-symbols, so that the scalar invariant of 2-knots in piecewise linear 4-manifolds could be computed explicitly.

     I will recall the classical definition of Massey
        products. Then I relate the triple Massey product to the ternary
        operation of the A_\infty minimal model. The goal will be to
        explain that the attempts to extract a local information from
        this ternary operation leads directly to the rediscovery of the
        triple Massey product. My rather elementary talk will be based on
        the first part of my preprint arXiv:2404.19607.</td>

            After briefly overviewing the state of the art of the functorial formulation of Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS), I will explain the importance of further generalising the mathematical structure underlying it. The main motivation comes from its applicability to String Theory, with quiver gauge theories playing a crucial role in the setting. However, as we shall see, generalising functorial HMS also constitutes a promising setting for pure mathematics advancements in their own right.

                    We shall review a theorem proved by Drummond-Cole in his thesis (following a suggestion of Kontsevich) which states that an action of the framed little disks operad and a trivialization of the circle action is the same information as an action of the Deligne-Mumford-Knudsen operad. Then we relate this theorem with the so-called Feynman compactification construction, which allows generalization of D-C’s theorem to the higher genus setup. This is partially a joint work with Lino Amorim.
